== About ==
Built with a minimal feature set
Unlimited number of object of 1byte to 5 terabytes in size
Each object is stored in a bucket
Each bucket can be stored in various regions of the world optimized for specific requirements
	- This results in optimized latency, minimize cost, address regulatory
	- Regions : US West (Oregon), US West (Northern California), 
	EU (Ireland), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), 
	South America (Sao Paulo), and GovCloud (US) Regions
Can be private or public and based on specific users
REST ability and SOAP interfaces
Encrypted Communication Available
HTTP and BitTorrent Protocol interfaces
Deletions rules can be created
Up to 1000 object can be deleted for each request

== Security ==
ACL - Access Control Lists
AIM - Identity Access Management

Permissions can be setup based on Buckets or By object basis

HTTPS and multiple mechanisms for managing keys

Logging options for who and when actions were performed

== Reliability ==
PUT and COPY operations synchronously store your data across multiple facilities 
 before returning SUCCESS
 
Reliability Backed by agreement - http://aws.amazon.com/s3-sla/

99.999999999% durability and 99.99% availability of objects over a given year

Designed to sustain the concurrent loss of data in two facilities

Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS)
   Allows reduced cost by storing less critical data at lower levels of redundancy
